We are a FTC Roboics team that very passionately represents Evergreen Valley High School. We work together in every way possible to present our best work to our fellow peers and to our fellow competitors. We treat everyone of our members with value and respect, and would never post a funny picture of anyone on https://theresistors.github.io/
